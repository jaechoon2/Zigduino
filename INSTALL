These installation instructions are for Windows, but other than the references to WinAVR,
they should work for all platforms.

To install under Windows:

	- Download the zipball from: 
	https://github.com/logos-electromechanical/Zigduino/zipball/master
	- Unzip the archive in your arduino-0018/hardware directory.
	- Restart the Arduino IDE. There will be a new entry in the boards sub-menu
	- Download the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC library from Atmel 
	(http://atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=4675) and unpack it to a 
	convenient location. 
	- Copy the contents of the MAC_v_2_4_2 directory over the MAC installation directory.
	This puts the board definition files in the correct place
	
On non-Windows platforms, don't unpack the tools/avr directory of the archive. You will 
need to install avr-gcc-4.3.3 or later and avr-libc-1.6.7 or later in order to compile
for the Atmega128RFA1
