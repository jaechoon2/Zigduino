THIS VERSION WORKS ONLY WITH PRE-1.0 VERSIONS OF ARDUINO.
For 1.0 and later versions, go to https://github.com/logos-electromechanical/Zigduino-1.0 instead!

Since 1.0 has been the state of the Arduino world for more than a year, this older version is no 
longer being actively maintained and should be considered of primarily historical interest.

This is the software required to run the Zigduino, from Logos Electromechanical LLC.
The Zigduino is a shield compatible Arduino clone based around the Atmega128RFA1. 
This package contains the following elements:

-- 	ported versions of the arduino-0021 bootloader and core libraries. Tone.cpp 
	has not yet been ported, however.

-- 	WinAVR-2010010; the version of this package provided with the normal Arduino 
	install is too old to support the Atmega128RFA1. users on Mac and Linux must
	do this by hand -- avr-gcc-4.3.2 and libc-1.6.7

-- 	Board abstraction files for Atmel's MAC package 
	(http://atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=4675)
	
	
See INSTALL for installation instruction.
